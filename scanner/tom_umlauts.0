// This one is probably a real edge case.
// The exercise description simply says that identifiers consist of letters and 
// digits, but doesn't really go into detail about what is meant by a 'letter'
// This could theoretically also include all kinds of umlauts and unicode characters
// The nature of my parser makes this easy, but I am unsure if this is the expected
// behaviour. I guess the UBLU test-cases won't ever use anything besides [a-zA-Z] 
// anyway.
